## Sentiment Analyzer - Movie Reviews
For this homework, I tried to analyze some reviews on the movie *Spotlight* and set up a few hypotheses to test the sentiment analyzer package.

### Introduction

*Spotlight* is a 2015 American biographical crime drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer. 
The film follows The Boston Globe's "Spotlight" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative journalist unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests.

It won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2015.


### Collecting Reviews
I used `imdb.com` to collect the reviews.
